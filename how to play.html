        <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
        <p><b>Introductions</b></p>
        <p>Know About Your Favourite Fantasy Cricket</p>
        <p>Cricket is a very popular sport in India. Millions of Indians play cricket. Many are already playing fantasy cricket every day and winning real money in the international and domestic tournaments like the Indian T20 League and the T20 World Cup. In the game, you select a virtual team by picking players from the two teams who are going to play the live match and compete with other participants. Your team scores points based on your playersâ€™ performance in the match. If you are a beginner, you should check out the game rules and the BigFan11 fantasy point system. With practice, you can easily become a highly skilled player.</p>

        <p><b>How to Create Team</b></p>
        <p>You can only pick a maximum of 10 players from one team. Your fantasy cricket team needs to constitute the following:</p>
        <p>Wicket-Keepers (Minimum - 1, Maximum - 8)</p>
        <p>Batsmen (Minimum - 1, Maximum - 8)</p>
        <p>All-rounders (Minimum - 1, Maximum - 8)</p>
        <p>Bowlers (Minimum - 1, Maximum - 8)</p>

        </div>

        <p><b>Player Combinations</b></p>
        <p>On selecting the 11 players, you will need to assign a captain and vice-captain. The captain will give you 2x points scored by them in the actual match. The vice-captain will give you 1.5x points scored by them in the actual match.</p>
        <p>Once you have chosen your combination, save your team, and you are good to go. Starting points are assigned to any player based on the announcement of his/her inclusion in the team. You should pick players that you feel will earn maximum points on the given day.</p>
