    <h1>GAMING POLICY</h1>
<p align="center"><h2>Responsible Gaming Policy-</h2></p>
<p align="center">We, at XL11, believe in a high level of user protection and responsible gaming and prioritize this over other interests. We actively promote responsible game play for our users believing that gaming is and should be done purely for entertainment. We take our users' well-being very seriously and in order to ensure their safety, this Responsible Gaming Policy describes the Companyâ€™s commitments, and your responsibility to promote responsible gaming practices and minimize the negative effects of excessive gaming.
    
    If you choose to play on our Platform, there are some general guidelines that can help make your playing experience safer, and avoid risk that you may indulge in excessive gaming:
    
    Games may be habit-forming or may involve an element of financial risk. Please play responsibly.
    Do not chase your losses.
    Set deposit limits for each day/month.
    Do not play with the sole intention to make money or to escape problems. Play in moderation and only for entertainment.
    Keep track of the time and monitor the amount of money you spend.
    Have a disciplined strategy and play within your bankroll. Add money to the XL11 Wallet only with money that you can afford to spend i.e. set a specific spending capacity for gaming.
    Never add money to the XL11 Wallet with money that you need for important or essential things.
    Pre-plan your purchases and the time you will spend playing on XL11 and stick to that limit, regardless of your performance.
    Don't play when you are upset, tired, or depressed. It is difficult to make informed choices when you are feeling down. Play games only for utilizing and enhancing your skills.
    Balance your gameplay duration with other activities that might interest you.
    Do not borrow money in order to make purchases on XL11.
    Avoid using all of the monies in the XL11 Wallet in a single game or session.
    Only participate in games that are commensurate with your competence level and financial capabilities. Do not get tempted to participate in high stakes tables despite winning consistently.
